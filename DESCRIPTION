Title: Project Climate Data Based on Changes in Distribution Shape
Version: 0.9.7
Author: Kevin Schwarzwald
Maintainer: Kevin Schwarzwald <kschwarzwald@uchicago.edu>
Description: Project climate time series into the future based on 
    estimated distributional changes of a different set of climate 
    time series, potentially spanning multiple runs over the same 
    time frame, based on the quantile mapping methodology for 
    multi-member climate ensembles developed by Haugen et al. (2018). 
    In its most common use, it allows for a weather or reanalysis
    variable (i.e. near-surface air temperature) to be projected
    by the estimated change in distribution shape of a large model
    ensemble, such as CESM-LE. This gives a future time series 
    reflecting the estimated distributional change in the model. 
    Code is built off of and based on code by Matz Haugen (original
    found here: https://github.com/matzhaugen/future-climate-emulations-analysis) 
    and is used with permission.
